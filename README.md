# Attendance-Management-System
An application that captures the face and uses ML to recognise the person and update attendance.

#Introduction:-
This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence. Using an attendance management system allows teachers to track each student’s exact arrival time and automatically notify parents if a kid is absent. Teachers can also track attendance in their classes, report absences, and send SMS and email notifications to parents about their children’s absences.
It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new students, addition of photos to the training dataset, viewing attendance reports, etc. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

#Our Work:-
We are going to develop a full-fledged Attendance Management System in Python. For this, we are going to use some new libraries of Python in order to create this project. As our project involves data and so we will use a new library SQLite3 in order to handle data. This project will ship with a lot of utility and a lot of learnings. 

#Features:-
Checks Camera
Captures Faces
Train Faces
Recognize Faces & Attendance
Automatic append attendance into Excel Sheet.
Automatic Email
Add new subjects
An option to manage attendance that shows today’s attendance data, add attendance for each subject, etc
Update attendance
Delete record
Attendance can be filtered by date or student

#Working:-
First, look at a picture and find all the faces in it
Second, focus on each face and be able to understand that even if a face is turned in a weird direction or in bad lighting, it is still the same person.
Third, be able to pick out unique features of the face that you can use to tell it apart from other people— like how big the eyes are, how long the face is, etc.
Finally, compare the unique features of that face to all the people you already know to determine the person’s name.

#Mission:
This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, out time, break time and attendance digitally. Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data using graphs to display the no. of employees present today, total work hours of each employee and their break time. Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system.

#Future Scope:-
Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials. This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. This project also convers web development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.
